##  What I'm Playing With

- 📎 Python basics & small programs  
- ☁️ Simple AI concepts 
- 📎 Tech ideas related to medicine & healthcare  
- ☁️ Random experiments that may or may not work

##  Current Goals

- [ ] Build a strong python foundation
- [ ] Learn How **AI** models are trained instead of literally just using them
- [ ] Try to understand the basics of **Machine Learning** in a simple way that I could understand
- [ ] Improve my *Math* and *Problem-Solving* skills
- [ ] BE CONSISTENT!

## Finally..

- I’m a **beginner**, studying computer science A-Level
- If it looks complicated, I want to understand it
